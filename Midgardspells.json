				"This spell is infamous for its use among feuding wizards and witches, because it lets the caster steal one or more spell slots from the target. {@i Grasp of the tupilak} remains effective for 1 hour or until it's triggered. When you make a successful melee attack, besides doing normal melee damage, the target takes an additional 2d4 necrotic damage and one or more of the defender's spell slots are transferred to you, for you to use as your own. Roll 1d6; the result equals the total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest level possible are transferred before lower-level slots.",
				"For example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one 5th-level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the target’s highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you receive a 3rd-level slot plus a 2nd-level slot, or a 3rd-level slot and two 1st-level slots if no 2nd-level slot is available. You can steal either arcane or divine spell slots, at your preference. Crucially, however, spell slots can be stolen only from casters who prepare spells in advance. If the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate level— for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has expended all its 1st and 2nd-level spell slots—then {@i grasp of the tupilak} has no effect, including causing no necrotic damage. If a stolen spell slot is higher than you're able to use, treat it as your highest-level slot.",

If the saving throw fails, the spell makes metal cling to metal, making it impossible to move pieces against each other. This effectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected. Metal constructs are completely paralyzed. An affected creature or construct repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. A {@spell grease|phb} spell dispels {@i lock armor} on everything in its area of effect."

A creature that's in the area when the spell is cast or that enters the affected area must make a successful Strength saving throw or sink up to its waist and be restrained by the mire. From that point on, the mire acts exactly as quicksand (see the GM's rules), but the DC for Strength checks to escape from the quicksand is your spell save DC. A character outside the mire trying to pull another creature free receives a +5 bonus on their Strength check against that DC."

The portion of your plane that's inside the bubble swaps places with a corresponding portion of the plane your music box is attuned with.",

Inanimate objects and non-ambulatory life (like trees) are cut off at the edge of the bubble, while living creatures that don't fit inside the bubble are shunted outside of it before the swap occurs. Otherwise, creatures from both planes that are caught inside the bubble are sent along with their chunk of reality to the other plane for the duration of the spell unless they make a successful Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast; with a successful save, a creature can choose whether to shift planes with the bubble or leap outside of it a moment before the shift occurs.",
				"Any natural reaction between the two planes occurs normally (fire spreads, water flows, etc.) while energy (such as necrotic energy) leaks slowly across the edge of the sphere (no more than a foot or two per hour). Otherwise, creatures and effects can move freely across the boundary of the sphere; for the duration of the spell, it becomes a part of its new location to the fullest extent possible, given the natures of the two planes. The two displaced bubbles shift back to their original places automatically after 24 hours.",
				"Note that the amount of preparation involved (acquiring and attuning the music box) precludes this spell from being cast on the spur of the moment. Because of its unpredictable and potentially wide-ranging effect, it's also advisable to discuss your interest in this spell with your GM before adding it to your character's repertoire."
